# Day 1: Working with Variables

## Task Overview

On Day 1 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge with Dr. Angela Yu, we focused on working with variables. The task involved creating a simple Band Name Generator that takes user inputs and combines them to generate a band name.

## Task Details

The program prompts the user for two pieces of information:
1. The name of the city they grew up in.
2. Their pet's name.

It then combines these two inputs to create and display a potential band name.

## Code

```python
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator.")
street = input("What's the name of the city you grew up in? \n")
pet = input("What's your pet's name? \n")
print("Your band name could be " + street + " " + pet)
```

## Concepts Learned

- **Printing to the console:** Using the `print()` function to display messages to the user.
- **Taking user input:** Using the `input()` function to capture user input from the console.
- **String concatenation:** Combining strings using the `+` operator to create the band name.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Copy the code into a Python file (e.g., `band_name_generator.py`).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing your Python file.
5. Run the program by typing `python band_name_generator.py` and follow the prompts.

## Reflection

Today, I revisited the basics of working with variables in Python. It was a great exercise to reinforce fundamental concepts and practice taking user inputs. I'm excited to continue building on this foundation in the coming days!
