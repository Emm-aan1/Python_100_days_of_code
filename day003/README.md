# Day 3: Control Flow and Logical Operators

## Project Overview

On Day 3 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge with Dr. Angela Yu, the focus was on control flow and logical operators. The exercises covered various scenarios to practice decision-making in code using if statements, logical operators, and conditional expressions.

## Exercises

### 1. Love Calculator

This exercise involves creating a "Love Calculator" that takes the names of two people and calculates their compatibility based on the occurrences of certain letters. The program counts specific letters in the combined names and uses these counts to generate a "love score." Based on the score, the program outputs a message indicating the compatibility of the two names.

### 2. Rollercoaster Ticket

This exercise calculates the ticket price for a rollercoaster ride based on the rider's age and height. The program first checks if the rider meets the minimum height requirement. If they do, it then determines the ticket price based on their age. Additional charges are added if the rider wants a photo taken. The final ticket price is then displayed.

### 3. Weeks Left Until 90 Days from Now

This exercise calculates the number of weeks left until 90 days from the current date. The program uses the current date and adds 90 days to it to find the target date. It then calculates the difference in days between the current date and the target date, and converts this difference into weeks. The number of weeks left is displayed to the user.

### 4. Treasure Island

This exercise is a text-based adventure game where the user makes choices to find the treasure. The program presents a series of decisions to the user, each leading to different outcomes. The user navigates through various scenarios by typing their choices. The goal is to find the treasure, but some choices lead to game-over scenarios. The program uses nested if statements to handle the different paths and outcomes based on the user's input.

## Key Concepts Learned

- **Control Flow:** Using if/elif/else statements to control the flow of the program based on conditions.
- **Logical Operators:** Implementing logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not` to combine multiple conditions.
- **String Manipulation:** Counting occurrences of characters in strings and combining strings for calculations.
- **Input Handling:** Capturing user input and using it to influence program behavior.

## How to Use

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Create Python files for each exercise.
3. Implement the logic as described in the explanations above.
4. Run each program by executing the Python files and follow the prompts.

## Reflection

Today's exercises provided a solid understanding of control flow and logical operators in Python. These foundational skills are essential for making decisions in programs and handling user input effectively. The hands-on practice through diverse exercises reinforced these concepts and prepared me for more advanced topics.
