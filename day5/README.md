# Day 5: Python Loops

## Exercises

### 1. Student Scores - Highest & Lowest

This exercise calculates the highest and lowest scores from a list of student scores.

#### How It Works

1. **Initialize Variables:** Store the highest and lowest scores.
2. **Loop Through Scores:** Iterate through the list to update the highest and lowest scores.
3. **Output:** Display the highest and lowest scores.

### 2. Add Even Numbers

Calculate the sum of all even numbers within a specified range.

#### How It Works

1. **Initialize Sum:** Store the sum of even numbers.
2. **Loop Through Range:** Iterate through the range of numbers.
3. **Check for Even Numbers:** Add even numbers to the sum.
4. **Output:** Display the sum of even numbers.

### 3. FizzBuzz Job

Print numbers from 1 to 100 with conditions:
- Multiples of 3: Print "Fizz".
- Multiples of 5: Print "Buzz".
- Multiples of both 3 and 5: Print "FizzBuzz".

#### How It Works

1. **Loop Through Range:** Iterate from 1 to 100.
2. **Check Conditions:** Print "Fizz," "Buzz," "FizzBuzz," or the number.

### 4. Generate Password

Generate a random password using letters, digits, and symbols.

#### How It Works

1. **Specify Character Sets:** Define lists of letters, digits, and symbols.
2. **User Input:** Capture the desired password length.
3. **Random Selection:** Randomly select characters to match the specified length.
4. **Shuffle and Combine:** Combine and shuffle the selected characters.
5. **Output:** Display the generated password.

## Key Concepts Learned

- **Loops:** Using `for` loops to iterate over data and perform repetitive tasks.
- **Conditionals:** Applying if-else conditions within loops.
- **List Operations:** Manipulating lists through indexing and appending.
- **Randomization:** Using Pythonâ€™s `random` module to generate random selections.

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Create Python files for each exercise.
3. Implement the logic as described in the explanations above.
4. Run each program by executing the Python files and follow the prompts.
