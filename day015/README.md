## Day 15: Coffee Machine Project â˜•

**Today's challenge:** Build a coffee machine simulator using Python! 

### Project Overview
This project simulates a coffee machine, allowing users to order different types of coffee. The machine checks for sufficient resources (water, milk, coffee, and money), processes payments, and dispenses the ordered coffee. 

### Core Functionalities 
* **Resource Management:** Tracks the available quantities of water, milk, coffee, and money.
* **Menu:** Defines the available coffee types, their ingredients, and prices.
* **Order Processing:** Takes user input for the desired coffee and validates the order.
* **Payment Processing:** Simulates coin insertion and checks if the payment is sufficient.
* **Coffee Dispense:** Deducts resources based on the chosen coffee and dispenses it (simulated by printing a message).

### Key Features 
* **Report Function:** Displays the current levels of resources and total money earned.
* **Error Handling:** Checks for insufficient resources and provides appropriate messages.

### Challenges Faced 
* Managing different data types (integers, floats, strings) for resources and prices.
* Implementing clear and concise function definitions.
* Ensuring accurate calculations for change and resource updates.

### Next Steps 
* Enhance the user interface with a more interactive experience.
* Implement a more realistic payment system (e.g., using different coin values).
* Expand the coffee menu with additional options.
