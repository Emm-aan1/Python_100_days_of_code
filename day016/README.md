# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Coffee Machine Project

The **Coffee Machine** project is a practical demonstration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. It simulates a simple coffee vending machine that allows users to order different types of coffee and manages the machine's resources efficiently.

### Key Features:
- **Resource Management:** The coffee machine keeps track of its available resources, including water, milk, coffee, and money.
- **Menu Selection:** Users can choose from a predefined menu of drinks: latte, cappuccino, and espresso.
- **Transaction Handling:** The machine processes user payments and provides change if necessary.
- **Resource Check:** Before making a drink, the machine checks if there are enough resources to fulfill the order.
- **Reporting:** Users can generate a report to view the current status of the machine’s resources.

## Turtle Graphics

The **Turtle Graphics** module in Python provides a way to draw shapes and designs using a virtual turtle. In this practice:
- A turtle named **Derrick** is created, which can be moved forward and backward to draw on the screen.
- The turtle's shape and color can be customized.
- The screen’s height is retrieved and displayed.

### Example Operations:
- Moving the turtle forward and backward.
- Customizing the turtle’s shape and color.
- Exiting the screen on a mouse click.

## PrettyTable

**PrettyTable** is a Python library used to create aesthetically pleasing ASCII tables. It is particularly useful for displaying tabular data in a readable format.

### Example Table:
- **Igbo Places:** A column listing several locations in the Igbo region.
- **Igbo Names:** A column listing common Igbo names.

### Table Features:
- **Column Alignment:** The table columns are aligned to the left for better readability.
- **Dynamic Data Entry:** Columns can be dynamically populated with data.
