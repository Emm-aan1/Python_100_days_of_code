## Day 10 - Functions with Outputs: Calculator Project

### Project Overview

The Day 10 project focuses on creating a basic calculator that utilizes functions with outputs. The goal of the project is to demonstrate how functions can be used to encapsulate logic, perform operations, and return results. This calculator handles basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Key Features

1. **Modular Design**: The calculator is designed using functions to perform specific operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This modular approach makes the code more organized and easier to maintain.

2. **User Input and Validation**: The calculator prompts the user to input numbers and select an arithmetic operation. It includes input validation to ensure that the user picks a valid operation.

3. **Continued Calculation**: After performing an operation, the user can choose to continue calculating with the result, start a new calculation, or exit the program.

4. **Error Handling**: The division function includes basic error handling to avoid division by zero, ensuring the program doesn't crash unexpectedly.

### How It Works

- **Performing Operations**: The calculator performs operations based on the userâ€™s input. The available operations include addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).

- **Operation Flow**:
  - The user is first prompted to enter a number.
  - The user then selects an operation from the list of available operations.
  - After selecting an operation, the user enters a second number.
  - The calculator performs the operation and displays the result.

- **Continuing or Restarting**:
  - The user is given the option to continue calculating with the current result, start over with a new calculation, or exit the program.

### Learning Points

- **Functions with Outputs**: Understanding how to create functions that take input, perform an operation, and return a result.
- **Control Flow**: Utilizing loops to manage user interactions and control the flow of the program.
- **Input Validation**: Implementing input validation to ensure that only valid operations are selected.
- **Error Handling**: Handling potential errors such as division by zero to make the program more robust.

This project is a practical application of using functions with outputs, and it reinforces concepts of modularity, user input handling, and basic error management in Python.
